## About Me

I’m a Computer Science student at the University of San Diego and a U.S. Air Force veteran with experience supporting mission-critical operations. I approach software engineering with a systems mindset — prioritizing reliability, structured problem-solving, and performance-aware design.

My primary interests include systems programming, networking, backend development, and simulation-based modeling. I focus on writing clean, testable code and building software that is scalable and maintainable.

Currently building projects that explore simulation, computer vision, and real-time interaction systems.
