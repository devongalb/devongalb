## About Me

Computer Science student at the University of San Diego and U.S. Air Force veteran with experience supporting mission-critical operations. I’m particularly interested in backend engineering, distributed systems, and performance-oriented software.

I enjoy building reliable systems, designing clean abstractions, and writing code that scales. My work emphasizes structured problem-solving, testability, and maintainability.

Currently focused on systems-level programming, simulation modeling, and real-time computer vision applications.
